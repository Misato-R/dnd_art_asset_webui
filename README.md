This is the webui part of the final assignment for a ug project. The model is too large to upload to github. For specific training, please refer to the presentation and paper. The webui must be based on AUTOMATIC1111 (https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). After running webui-user.bat in AUTOMATIC1111, run dnd_lora_webui.py. You can open it locally at http://127.0.0.1:7861.
